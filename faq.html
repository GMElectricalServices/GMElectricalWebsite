                        <summary>What is Solar PV and how does it work?</summary>
                        <p>Solar Photovoltaic (PV) systems convert sunlight directly into electricity using semiconductor materials. When sunlight hits the solar panels, it creates an electric current. This current is then converted by an inverter into usable AC (alternating current) electricity for your home or business.</p>

                    <details class="faq-item">
                        <summary>How much space do I need for solar panels?</summary>
                        <p>The space required depends on your energy needs and the type of panels used. A typical domestic solar PV system in the UK might require about 15-25 square meters of south-facing roof space. We conduct a detailed site survey to determine the optimal layout for your property.</p>

                    <details class="faq-item">
                        <summary>What happens on cloudy days or at night?</summary>
                        <p>On cloudy days, solar panels still produce electricity, though at a reduced rate. At night, they produce no electricity. This is where battery storage comes in handy, allowing you to store excess energy generated during the day for use when the sun isn't shining.</p>
                    </details>
                    <details class="faq-item">
                        <summary>How long do solar panels last?</summary>
                        <p>Most modern solar panels come with performance warranties of 20-25 years, guaranteeing a certain output efficiency over that period. The panels themselves can last much longer, often 30+ years, though their efficiency may gradually decrease over time.</p>

                    <details class="faq-item">
                        <summary>Why should I add battery storage to my solar PV system?</summary>
                        <p>Battery storage allows you to store excess electricity generated by your solar panels during the day, rather than exporting it back to the grid. You can then use this stored energy during peak hours, at night, or on cloudy days, significantly increasing your self-consumption and reducing reliance on grid electricity.</p>

                    <details class="faq-item">
                        <summary>Can battery storage power my home during a power cut?</summary>
                        <p>Some battery storage systems offer a "backup" or "off-grid" mode, which can provide power to essential circuits in your home during a grid outage. This feature needs to be specifically designed into the system during installation.</p>

                    <details class="faq-item">
                        <summary>How long do battery storage systems last?</summary>
                        <p>Battery storage systems typically come with warranties ranging from 5 to 10 years, often guaranteeing a certain number of charge/discharge cycles. The lifespan depends on usage patterns, temperature, and the specific battery technology.</p>

                    <details class="faq-item">
                        <summary>What is the benefit of having an EV charger at home?</summary>
                        <p>Having a home EV charger provides unmatched convenience, allowing you to charge your electric vehicle overnight or whenever it's parked. It's often more cost-effective than public charging, especially when combined with off-peak electricity tariffs or solar PV.</p>
                    </details>
                    <details class="faq-item">
                        <summary>What type of EV charger do I need?</summary>
                        <p>The type of EV charger you need depends on your vehicle's charging capabilities, your budget, and your typical daily driving. Chargers range from slower 3.6kW (Type 1) to faster 7.4kW (Type 2) for domestic use. Our experts can help you choose the right one.</p>

                        <summary>How long does it take to charge an EV at home?</summary>
                        <p>Charging times vary greatly depending on the EV's battery size, the charger's power output, and the car's onboard charger capacity. A 7.4kW home charger can typically add around 25-30 miles of range per hour of charging.</p>
